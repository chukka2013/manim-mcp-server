# Manim MCP Server

## Overview

This is an MCP (Multi-Modal Command Processor) server that executes Manim animation code and returns the generated video. It allows users to send Manim scripts and receive the rendered animation.

## Features

- Executes Manim Python scripts.
- Saves animation output in a visible media folder.
- Allows users to clean up temporary files after execution.
- Portable and configurable via environment variables.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Manim (Community Version)
- MCP

### Install Manim

```sh
pip install manim
```

### Install MCP

```sh
pip install mcp
```

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/abhiemj/manim-mcp-server.git
cd manim-mcp-server
```

## Integration with Claude

To integrate the Manim MCP server with Claude, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
     "manim-server": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/python",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/manim-mcp-server/manim_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Finding Your Python Path

To find your Python executable path, use the following command:

#### Windows (PowerShell):
```sh
(Get-Command python).Source
```

#### Windows (Command Prompt/Terminal):
```sh
where python
```

#### Linux/macOS (Terminal):
```sh
which python
```

This ensures that Claude can communicate with the Manim MCP server to generate animations dynamically.
